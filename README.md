# Intel-Scene-Classification
Computer Vision Hackathon

Contest Home Page: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-intel-scene-classification-challe/

Problem Statement:
How do we, humans, recognize a forest as a forest or a mountain as a mountain? We are very good at categorizing scenes based on the semantic representation and object affinity, but we know very little about the processing and encoding of natural scene categories in the human brain. In this practice problem, you are provided with a dataset of ~25k images from a wide range of natural scenes from all around the world. Your task is to identify which kind of scene can the image be categorized into.

Dataset Description:
There are 17034 images in train and 7301 images in test data. The categories of scenes and their corresponding labels in the dataset are as follows -

{'buildings' -> 0, 
'forest' -> 1,
'glacier' -> 2,
'mountain' -> 3,
'sea' -> 4,
'street' -> 5 }

NOTE:
The code file will be shared after the competition ends.
